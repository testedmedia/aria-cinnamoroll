## TIPS FOR DM SUCCESS

1. **Personalize**: Reference their specific content ("loved your cinnamoroll collection video!")
2. **Keep it SHORT**: Instagram DMs get skimmed. 3-4 sentences max.
3. **No pressure**: "no pressure at all" / "only if you like it" removes the sales feeling
4. **Time it right**: Send DMs between 10AM-2PM or 6-9PM in their timezone
5. **Follow first**: Follow their account before DMing so you show up as a follower
6. **Story reply**: Even better - reply to one of their stories first, build rapport, THEN pitch
7. **Micro-influencers convert better**: 10K-50K accounts have 3-5x higher engagement than 100K+ accounts
8. **Track responses**: Screenshot every DM sent, note who responds

## FOLLOW-UP (if no response after 3 days)
```
