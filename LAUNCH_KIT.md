**Title:** Aria's Sanrio Adventure - free kawaii catching game with 41 collectibles and a Valentine's Day event happening right now

**Body:**

Hey r/WebGames! 👋

I built a free browser-based catching game called **Aria's Sanrio Adventure** and just launched a Valentine's Day limited event that runs through Feb 16.

**What it is:** You catch falling boba, sweets, and Sanrio-themed items while dodging bombs. Think casual arcade vibes meets kawaii collecting.

**The hook is the collection system.** There are 41 collectible items across rarity tiers (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Secret). You unlock Blind Boxes that reveal Sanrio characters like Cinnamoroll, Hello Kitty, My Melody, Kuromi, and more. It's got that "gotta catch 'em all" itch.

**Features:**
- 🧋 41 collectible items with rarity tiers
- 🎁 Blind Box reveals with 12 Sanrio characters
- ⭐ Star Shop for power-up boosts
- 🎰 Lucky Spin (free daily spin!)
- 🎯 Daily Challenges (3 new tasks every day)
- 👗 6 unlockable avatar outfits (Hello Kitty Bow, My Melody Hood, Cinnamoroll Ears, Kuromi Hat, and more)
- 🏆 14 achievements to earn
- 🌍 Global leaderboard
- 💝 Valentine's Event LIVE now with 4 exclusive items (Cupid Cinnamoroll, Valentine Pompompurin, Heart Boba, Love Letter Cookie)

Works on any phone or desktop browser. No download, no account needed, no ads. Just open and play.

The Valentine's items disappear after Feb 16 so if you're into limited-time collecting, now's the time.

Would love to hear what you think! Happy to answer any questions about the dev process too.
